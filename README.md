<h1>Networking Labs Portfolio</h1> <h2>Description</h2> This section showcases the networking labs I have completed using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each lab includes a brief explanation of its objectives and the tools used to demonstrate my practical knowledge in networking. <br /> <h2>Labs Completed</h2> <h3>1. Basic Router Security Configuration</h3> <p>Secured routers by configuring passwords, enabling SSH for secure remote management, and disabling unused ports to reduce security vulnerabilities.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>2. Basic Router Configuration</h3> <p>Performed initial router setup, including assigning hostnames, configuring interface IP addresses, and enabling routing protocols for network connectivity.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>3. Basic Switch Configuration</h3> <p>Configured a switch for VLAN creation, port security, and management access to improve network segmentation and security.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>4. Basic Serial Connection Configuration</h3> <p>Established WAN communication by configuring serial connections between routers and setting up encapsulation protocols for data transfer.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>5. VLAN Configuration</h3> <p>Designed and implemented VLANs to segment and organize network traffic, enhancing performance and security within the network.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>6. VLAN Configuration with Trunk Encapsulation</h3> <p>Enabled VLAN traffic to pass between switches by configuring trunk ports with 802.1Q encapsulation protocols.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>7. Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a Stick)</h3> <p>Set up inter-VLAN communication using a single router interface configured with subinterfaces for each VLAN.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>8. Inter-VLAN Routing Troubleshooting</h3> <p>Diagnosed and resolved issues in inter-VLAN routing, including correcting misconfigurations and improving network connectivity.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>9. Local Username-Password Database Configuration</h3> <p>Created local user accounts and configured authentication to secure administrative access on network devices.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI) <br /> <h3>10. Message of the Day (MOTD) and Login Banners</h3> <p>Set up Message of the Day and login banners to display organizational notices and security warnings upon device access.</p> <b>Tools Used:</b> - Cisco Packet Tracer - Command Line Interface (CLI)
